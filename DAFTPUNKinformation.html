                <p><b>Daft Punk</b>, the iconic French electronic music duo, comprised of Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter, left an indelible mark on the global music scene. <br>
                    Emerging in the 1990s, <b>Daft Punk</b> achieved widespread acclaim for their innovative blend of house, techno, and funk, characterized by infectious beats and futuristic soundscapes. <br></p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Their breakthrough came with the release of "Homework" in 1997, featuring the hit single "Around the World." <br>
                    The duo continued to push boundaries with critically acclaimed albums like "Discovery" and "Random Access Memories," the latter earning multiple <b>Grammy Awards</b>, including <b>Album of the Year</b>. <br><br>
                    Daft Punk was not only recognized for their musical prowess but also for their enigmatic personas, often concealing their identities behind futuristic helmets. <br>
                    In a surprise announcement in 2021, <b>Daft Punk</b> officially disbanded, marking the end of an era and leaving behind a legacy of pioneering electronic music.</p>
                <h3>Why Daft Punk?</h3>
                <p>I chose <b>Daft Punk</b> for this website because they are an internationally known French music group.<br>
                    I like their music and how they conserved privacy by not telling the music world who they were.</p>
